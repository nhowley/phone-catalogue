The phone catalogue displays a list of phones and their prices and colour. When you click on one, you can see more details of it. It's possible to delete and add phones to the catalogue from the homepage.

To run the app:
1. Navigate to /server and run "npm install" and then run "node.js"
2. In a separate terminal, navigate to /client, run "npm install" and then run "npm start"

To do with more time:
- Add better styling (colours, buttons, form etc.)
- Fix error with deleting (refresh immediately)
- Add E2E testing with Cypress
- Add update phone functionality
- Use SQL database instead of JSON file
- Deploy to Heroku
